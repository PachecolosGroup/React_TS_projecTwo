# React + TypeScript + Vite

This was my first time typing Typescript in a project made for a Html template and using React, hooks, states to make him more interactive, changes, will be done as the project or I get more knowledge in the long run.


Still pending to do more changes with {
  quantity : any /// on header 
} 

And others more in the whole project, I promise to comeback and fix them once
I got more understanding on TypeScript and React.
